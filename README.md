# Itec - Prompt Engineering

Repository created to support an application for an undergraduate research position at ITEC. The goal is to present a clear, reproducible set of prompt examples and their results so reviewers can evaluate methodology and outcomes.

## Repository structure

- `1_prompt.txt` - My original prompt used to instruct the model (source prompt).
- `2_text_for_review.txt` - Text selected for review or to be used as context in prompts.
- `3_input_prompt.txt` - The prompt with the text for review in the correct spot in the structure.
- `4_results.txt` - Analysis of model outputs and results produced when running the prompts. Link for each one of the chats.
- `README.md` - This file.
